// Public runtime API for the star catalog. The catalog data itself is
// precomputed by scripts/build-catalog.mjs (parses src/data/*.csv, runs
// normalization, hierarchical multi-star layout, cluster detection,
// COM computation) and lives in catalog.generated.json. That JSON is
// gitignored — the npm scripts (build:catalog, prebuild, predev,
// pretypecheck) keep it in sync with the CSVs.
//
// This module:
//   - Re-exports the precomputed STARS and STAR_CLUSTERS as immutable arrays.
//   - Owns the runtime k-d trees over both (rebuilt fresh on each module
//     load — the trees are mutable index instances, not catalog data).
//   - Owns the type definitions other modules consume.
//   - Owns runtime-only constants (CLASS_COLOR for the stars shader,
//     WAYPOINT_STAR_IDS for the labels module).
//
// Adding a new CSV column? Update parseCsvCatalog in build-catalog.mjs
// and add the field to the Star interface here. The two have to agree —
// there's no type bridge between the build script and the runtime.
